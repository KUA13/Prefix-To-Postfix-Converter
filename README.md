# Prefix-To-Postfix-Converter

This program is able to convert prefix expressions into postfix expressions. 
This program will read each line in .txt file and convert each valid prefix 
expression into a postfix expression. Each prefix expression should be loacted 
on a new line for this program to work properly. Any white space in the file 
will be ignored. The program will prompt your for the file path of the input 
file that will be read. It will then prompt you for the file path of the file 
where the output will be written. If a file exists at that location, it's 
contents will be completely overwritten. If no file exists at that location, 
a file will be created. The output will show both each input and each output.
