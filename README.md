# Prefix-To-Postfix-Converter

This program is able to convert prefix expressions into postfix expressions. This program will read each line in a .txt file and convert each valid prefix expression into a postfix expression. Each prefix expression should be loacted on a new line for this program to work properly. Any white space in the file will be ignored. The program will prompt the user for the file path of the input file. It will then prompt the user for the file path of the output file. If a file exists at that location, it's contents will be completely overwritten. If no file exists at that location, a file will be created. The output file will show both each prefix expression, followed by each generated postfix expression.
